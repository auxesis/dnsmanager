DNSManager
============

DNSManager is a web application for managing your DNS zones directly, via
zone transfers and dynamic DNS updates.

You configure DNSManager by listing the zones you want to be able to edit,
along with the master host for the zone, and setup one or more users.  Once
that's done, just fire up the included webserver (./script/server) and
proceed to http://<hostname>:3000/ to login and start editing.

Further documentation

The documentation for the system is in the following places (presented in
suggested reading order):

* The FAQ is in doc/FAQ.

* Installation instructions are in doc/INSTALL.

* The operations manual is in doc/MANUAL.

* My (very rough) future feature wishlist is in doc/TODO.
