Features I want in DNS Manager
---

Next release:

* "Master/slave" domains (make a change to the master domain, and the same
  record gets added to all of the slave domains)
* Structured UI for different record types (so if you pick to add an MX
	record, for instance, you get a form which asks you for the
	preference number and hostname)
* Comprehensive sanity checking on input
* Simple Web service interface to the basic update functionality

Customer-facing release:

* An attractive UI
* Better user management -- specifically, the ability to restrict certain
	users to only editing some domains, and groups for users to be
	assigned to, so you can easily modify the list of permitted domains
	for all of the users in a group.

Wishlist items for the dim future:

* Automatic discovery of the zone master (via SOA lookup)
* Reverse address management
