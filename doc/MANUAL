Authentication
================

To prevent just anyone from modifying your zones, DNSManager contains a
simple authentication system.  To add users or change their passwords, just
run "./script/dmtool password <username> <password>" from the root of the
DNSManager installation.  This will create a new user if the user doesn't
already exist, or will modify the existing user's password to suit.

There is not currently any way of restricting a user to editing some subset
of the available domains, although this is a planned feature (for the
distant future).


The List Of Domains To Edit
=============================

As an ease-of-use thing, you must create a list of all of the domains you
wish to be able to edit using DNSManager.  This is quite a simple list --
you just need to create config/domains.yml, and fill it full of stanzas like
this:

example.org:
  master: 127.0.0.1

The format is quite simple -- the first line is the zone to edit, while the
second line (indented with spaces) specifies the hostname or IP address of
the master DNS server for the zone.

If you wish to use a TSIG key to authenticate access to the domain (highly
recommended), place the key files in config/dns_keys, and specify the key
name as part of the domain record, like this:

example.org:
  master: 127.0.0.1
  key: Kexample.org.+157.+00000

When giving a key, do not add the '.private' or '.key' extension; DNSManager
will add that for you if needed.
