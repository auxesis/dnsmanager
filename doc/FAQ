Common Questions
------------------

Q: What's wrong with hand-editing my zonefiles?

A: Nothing, as long as you're not using dynamic DNS updates, and you're
   quite careful to update the serial and not make any syntax errors.
   
   It's becoming increasingly common for organisations to configure their
   DHCP server to modify the DNS zone when a DHCP lease is made (so that you
   can SSH to the hostname rather than have to guess at the IP address, for
   instance).  I first started working on DNSManager after deploying such a
   solution, since once you've got dynamic DNS happening, you can never
   safely edit your zone files by hand, since the DNS server might decide to
   go and change the zone files itself at an inopportune moment.
   
   There's also the issue of always being sure that you're creating a
   syntactically valid zone file, and updating the serial.  Failing to
   update the serial before reload means that your updates sometimes get
   lost, and creating an invalid zone file means pain and suffering.  You
   can (or at least, will be able to in the future) point a lesser mortal at
   DNSManager and have them manage DNS entries, instead of needing a
   relative guru to massage zone files.


Q: How do I install this program?

A: See docs/INSTALL.


Q: How do I setup my DNS server to allow DNSManager to edit the zones?

A: That's a bit of a long question.  The short answer is to allow zone
   transfers and updates from the IP address on which DNSManager is running,
   or the TSIG key you configured for the domain.  The long answer is in
   docs/BIND_CONFIG.
